Scratchpad is a convenient way to develop and
test your javascript.

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,15
This website is supposed to compare the two text
areas above

3
00:00:10,15 --> 00:00:15,289
and put the result underneath, when I click
the "Diff" button. I have written the

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,34
HTML and CSS

5
00:00:16,34 --> 00:00:20,21
and included some JavaScript library
functions but having it hooked them up.

6
00:00:20,21 --> 00:00:27,21
So when I click the button, nothing
happens. Scratch is a source editor.

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,239
When I click "Display" the code is evaluated in the
current page

8
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,25
and the result is pasted back into the pad as
a comment.

9
00:00:38,25 --> 00:00:45,25
This is telling me that I probably have a typo
in my selector.

10
00:00:50,61 --> 00:00:54,03
Let's assign these two variables and compare
them using the library function.

11
00:00:54,03 --> 00:00:59,28
"Display" makes it really easy to check
that I'm on the right track.

12
00:00:59,28 --> 00:01:02,42
Let assign this to the output diff.

13
00:01:02,42 --> 00:01:05,93
This time I choose "Run"

14
00:01:05,93 --> 00:01:11,19
and it just runs the script in the page. That looks good.

15
00:01:11,19 --> 00:01:15,68
So I wrap this in a function and assign it to the
diff-button's click event.

16
00:01:15,68 --> 00:01:20,92
And this time I choose "Reload And Run"

17
00:01:20,92 --> 00:01:27,92
that reloads the current page with the script
attached. And "diff" works.

18
00:01:28,18 --> 00:01:32,11
I can save this file back to desk.

19
00:01:32,11 --> 00:01:36,43
Close Scratchpad, reload the page.

20
00:01:36,43 --> 00:01:43,04
This is just a really quick introduction
to Scratchpad. For more information
